# Causality is not a part of the actual world

This is an update of a point that I have written about in two essays,

* [Could have, would have, should have](https://github.com/jpivarski/could-have-would-have-should-have) (2020)
* [Reality and reality boxes](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/i8C9KSryDFj4EENvx/reality-and-reality-boxes) (2023)

but in the form of a presentation for the Fermi Society of Philosophy, and focusing on just the point about causality: that it's a feature of possible worlds, not the actual world.

## Abstract

"Causality" and "to cause" are common words in physics, particularly in relativity and quantum mechanics. This would make it seem like causality is a quantity in physics, akin to energy or gravitational strength, but it is not. For "A causes B" to mean "B _would_ happen if A happens," a causality relation has to range over sets of possible worlds, not just the actual world in which physical quantities reside.

In this talk, I'll argue in favor of causality as a property of a set of possible worlds, both at the qualitative level that it is usually presented in modal logic, but also with computer simulations that serve as a mock-up of a set of physical worlds. In particular, I'll show a case of two physically identical worlds that are products of different physical laws with a different causal structure, to underscore the point that causality requires more than the actual world to be sensible.
