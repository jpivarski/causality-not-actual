# Causality is not a part of the actual world

This is an update of a point that I have written about in two essays,

* [Could have, would have, should have](https://github.com/jpivarski/could-have-would-have-should-have) (2020)
* [Reality and reality boxes](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/i8C9KSryDFj4EENvx/reality-and-reality-boxes) (2023)

but in the form of a presentation for the Fermi Society of Philosophy, and focusing on just the point about causality: that it's a feature of possible worlds, not the actual world.
